# docker-mariadb

- run `sh run.sh` to boot up, this will also print the IP of your local mariadb server
- run `sh stop.sh` to stop
- run `sh get-ip.sh` to get the IP of your mariadb server if you forget

You will need to connect in TCP mode `port 3306` is the port, but that
is the usual default port anyway so may not need to be set.
